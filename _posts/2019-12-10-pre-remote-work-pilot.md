## Details on the Remote Work Pilot

I haven't actually started working remotely just yet -- that's in just under a week on December 16.

Enova's running a small work-remote pilot program. In the future, this will lead to new remote hires, plus (I think) other in-office workers transitioning to remote. The benefits of work to the company are saving money on desk space and broadening the talent pool (plus the option of remote-work as a perk to those who want it).

I am currently a Software Engineer II.

## Why I'm Keeping a Journal

For Enova's benefit: My entries can be used as qualitative markers to identify any part of the process that is or isnâ€™t going smoothly. Also, excerpts from these journals could potentially be used as blog posts to attract new remote talent.

For my own benefit: Journaling in general helps me clear my head and understand how I think and feel about things. I figure my first time working remote will come with some interesting challenges to work through, and I want to document those things so I can remain aware of them and ultimately grow from them.

For the benefit of those considering remote work: I'm also hopeful my journal entries could be useful to read for those who are considering transitioning from in-office work to remote work at Enova (or other companies).

## A Few Ways I'm Preparing for Remote Work

### Collaboration Tools

I've been looking into tools that will help make remote work easier.

**A mic.** For instance, right now (prior to the pilot program), remote standups are difficult. Usually there's at least one person who's too far away from the low-quality computer mic, and it's either difficult or impossible to decipher what they're saying. A proposed solution is to have a dedicated omnidirectional mic for standups, something my manager is looking into.

**Pair programming.** One of my coworkers suggested this tool called [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/), which can be used with the Atom text editor.

**Whiteboarding.** In-person whiteboarding doesn't really work for remote folks. There's glare on the whiteboard, or it's located on a side wall the camera doesn't point to, or it's too far away... Instead, whiteboarding will have to shift online (or be done with altogether). Planning on [reading up more on this here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-online-whiteboard/).

### Maintaining Mental Health

One of the areas I have the most trepidation about for remote work is whether it'll negatively affect my mental health. I do like going into the office and chatting with colleagues, getting snacks, strolling around downtown, and these things definitely lift my mood.

I also recognize, from reading others' accounts, that remote work has the potential to be isolating. It also has the potential to feel confining, since I could easily spend my entire life contained in my one-bedroom apartment.

I plan to experiment with a number of strategies to try to proactively offset this stuff. Those experiments will include:

1) Scheduling coffee with friends or coworkers downtown so I have a reason to leave my apartment, and get some socialization.
2) Scheduling workouts almost daily. I typically only work out 1-2 times per week in the evening, but since exercise is so directly tied to mood, I'm thinking of working out most days, and trying to do so in the morning. There's a yoga and barre studio (wtf is barre? Maybe I'll find out) a very short walk from my apartment, so I may try that out.
3) Setting aside time to write. Definitely to journal about my remote work experience at least. This feels like it will help me process any difficulties that come up.
4) 'Remote office rooms' with a friend or two of mine that work remote for different companies. We had spoken about trying out a system where we keep a videochat open during the day and catch up / shoot the sh\*t during breaks.
5) Going for walks. I already do this downtown, but there's a more natural cadence to it (i.e. after a meeting I'll go to a coffee shop a short walk away, which gets me some fresh air). I may start scheduling time blocks for walks when I'm working remotely.
6) ??? More to come I'm sure.

Overall I'd like to experiment and document my experience with these strategies to figure out what works best for me personally.

## The First Half of 2018: Books I'm Gonna Read

I've got a number of different books I'm planning on reading this year. Here's what they are, how I found out about them, and why I'm interested in reading them.

- **Modern Romance - Aziz Ansari**

- [**The Diary of Anais Nin (Vols. 1-7)**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011M9IRT8/ref=series_rw_dp_sw) - I had heard the name swirling around before, but I became interested because I would consistently see someone with the username anaisnin posting XL-size Visvim clothes on a secondhand online clothes marketplace I like to browse. So eventually I got curious and googled it, and it seems Ms. Nin had some interesting ideas. She wrote erotica, among other things, and her stories sometimes included the topic of incest (she and her father were involved in this way). I ended up becoming curious about her diaries. I've been keeping a more-or-less daily journal in the morning. Mostly throwaway things about my upcoming day, or what I did yesterday, rather than deep thoughts, but doing this has renewed my curiosity in what others' diaries look like. Diaries can be an ultimate private space, where we're not writing for any audience other than ourselves, and therefore can write freely about whatever's on our minds. I get a little forbidden thrill of intimacy from the idea of reading someone else's diary in this way.

- [**Ubik - Philip K. Dick**](https://www.amazon.com/Ubik-Philip-K-Dick/dp/0547572298) && [We Can Remember it for You Wholesale (PDF)]("We Can Remember it for You Wholesale.) - I read my first of Dick's novels in late 2017 (the Man in the High Castle; I picked it up while browsing in Wicker Park's Myopic Books). The first thing I noticed as I settled into the book was that the grammar of Man in the High Castle felt odd and almost syncopated, off-beat, but compellingly so. I found myself drawn in by the characters and their place in his imagined Axis-victorious world post-WWII. Recently, I bought a secondhand 'Disguise' neck gaiter/face mask from the brand Cav Empt, a visual-heavy brand cofounded by Japanese streetwear stalwart Sk8thing (Sk8thing contributed heavily to the early designs of A Bathing Ape, which had by far the best sense of humor of any streetwear brand as far as I'm concerned). I read [an interview with the other cofounder, Toby Feltwell](http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/31437/1/cav-empt-discuss-streetwear-grime-and-anonymity), who explained the Cav Empt brand's name: 

> The character Pat Conley in Philip K Dick’s “Ubik” has psychic powers that allow her to change the past, and she has “caveat emptor” (buyer beware) tattooed on her shoulder. The first thing we did was a Ubik homage T and Sk8thing put “CAV EMPT” on the shoulders.

The idea of reading another PKD novel was called forth from the back of my mind, and given the Cav Empt tie-in, I figured this would be an excellent choice.

There's this idea from a book I got a few years ago called 'Steal Like an Artist': find out the things that inspired the people who inspire you, and trace that tree of inspiration as far back as you can go. So in a way, it feels like revisiting PKD would be doing this with Cav Empt / Sk8thing.

Might be a good idea, next, to find out who inspired PKD.

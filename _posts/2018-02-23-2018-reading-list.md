## The First Half of 2018: Books I'm Gonna Read

I've got a number of different books I'm planning on reading this year. Here's what they are, how I found out about them, and why I'm interested in reading them.

I believe it's important to always be reading a fiction book, and to sometimes be reading a non-fiction book. Fiction before bedtime helps me clear my head, and life, for whatever reason, always seems to be better when I'm in the middle of an engaging book.

I've avoided putting any business books on here, because I often get a mediocre empty feeling when I read those. Like deliberately eating nothing but saltines for lunch. I tend to get the same feeling when reading non-fiction 'sociological' books, so I am a little concerned about Modern Romance, but, we'll see.

All right! Here goes!

## 1. [The Three Marriages](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Marriages-Reimagining-Work-Relationship/dp/159448435X)

I didn't stumble on this book myself. I took it from a pile of books my old roommate J was leaving behind as he moved to New York. The idea is that in addition to the literal marriage you might have in life, you also ought to enter into two other lifelong marriage contracts: to your work, and to your internal self. Its main point seems to be doing away with the concept of work-life balance, and working to align your work, romantic, and internal selves instead of trying to compartmentalize them. To be a whole person who is consistent across each contract.

To entertain the author's ideas is to have a discussion with oneself about personal values. I consider the best part of the fraternity I was involved in during college to be a set of weekly group discussions about personal values. Most of these discussions took place during the pledgeship process. I was lucky enough to go through these discussions three times: once as a pledge in the fraternity and then twice again as I ran the pledgeship program. I can't speak for fraternities as a whole, and no other elements of modern frats (heavy drinking/partying, doing stupid shit, bro-y machismo) really jive with me. But these discussions provided some very good prompts for self-reflection and make me glad I was involved.

It's rare that we sit down among others and examine our individual and collective values: not just state them, but pull them out of the dirt and turn them over like rocks to see the beetles crawling underneath. I think to do this effectively we need formal prompts (whether through some kind of group discussion, or a book like this). Natural conversation just doesn't lead to the rigorous examination of values. I hope The Three Marriages will challenge some of my personal values. I'm either going to come out with a clearer sense of what work-life balance means to me, or end up changing my view, agreeing with the author, and deciding that the usual concept of work-life balance is misguided.

I've already begun reading The Three Marriages, and a standout feature is the quality of the writing. The author's a poet, so it stands to reason he has a strong command of language. I can tell you that this book has little fluff so far, and feels overwhelmingly more engaging and thought-provoking than many books claiming to aid in self-reflection.

## 2. [Ubik - Philip K. Dick](https://www.amazon.com/Ubik-Philip-K-Dick/dp/0547572298) && [We Can Remember it for You Wholesale (PDF)]("We Can Remember it for You Wholesale.)

I picked up the Man in the High Castle in late 2017 while browsing in Myopic Books and read it shortly afterwards. The oddly syncopated grammar and character motivations drew me into its world.

Recently, I bought a secondhand 'Disguise' neck gaiter/face mask from the brand Cav Empt, a visual-heavy brand cofounded by Japanese streetwear stalwart Sk8thing (Sk8thing contributed heavily to the early designs of A Bathing Ape, which had by far the best sense of humor of any streetwear brand as far as I'm concerned). I recently read [an interview with the other cofounder, Toby Feltwell](http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/31437/1/cav-empt-discuss-streetwear-grime-and-anonymity), who explained the Cav Empt brand's name: 

> The character Pat Conley in Philip K Dick’s “Ubik” has psychic powers that allow her to change the past, and she has “caveat emptor” (buyer beware) tattooed on her shoulder. The first thing we did was a Ubik homage T and Sk8thing put “CAV EMPT” on the shoulders.

The idea of reading another PKD novel seemed ripe, and given the Cav Empt tie-in, I figured Ubik would be an excellent choice.

Also, there's this idea from a book I got a few years ago called 'Steal Like an Artist': find out the things that inspired the people who inspire you, and trace that tree of inspiration as far back as you can go. In this way, revisiting PKD means looking to the inspirations of Cav Empt / Sk8thing.

Might be a good idea, next, to find out who inspired PKD.

## 3. [Modern Romance - Aziz Ansari](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Romance-Aziz-Ansari/dp/0143109251)

My girlfriend and I met on Tinder, and I'd like to hear what Aziz has to say about online dating. More and more of my friends and acquaintances seem to be meeting people online, and there's plenty of problems that come along with that. I don't have a ton of expectations for this besides having read reviews that suggest it's somewhat sociological. I think this might be what I was hoping for when I read 'Dataclysm' (by an OKCupid founder; not great, do not recommend reading the whole book) a few years ago.

I wasn't very aware of Aziz (he really is the kind of celebrity who feels approachable enough to refer to by his first name) until about two years ago, when my girlfriend introduced me to one of her favorite shows, Parks and Rec. Tom Haverford's weird, contradictory whininess mixed with his desire to be adult/classy/baller was funny, and I ended up loving the show overall. It was good timing, because the first season of Master of None had come out around the same time, and I liked its focus on the everyday problems of the late twenty-something/mid-thirty-something in a major city. By no means does it map onto my life anywhere near perfectly, and I'm not old enough yet for it to be fully relatable, but it seemed a preview of how life could be for me or my friends in the years to come (including the part where friends have kids, and possibly get divorced despite seeming happy). 

## 4. [The Peripheral - William Gibson](https://www.amazon.com/Peripheral-William-Gibson/dp/0425276236)

I'm working on my second novel draft. It's about a character who's a fan of anime, cyberpunk, Acronym, and he references William Gibson's philosophies and books. A nice excuse to read another Gibson book, and this time one that's published in 2014 (previously I've read Pattern Recognition, which I loved, and Neuromancer; both are a good deal older). Not much more to say here.

## 5. [2666 - Roberto Bolano](https://www.amazon.com/2666-Novel-Roberto-Bola%C3%B1o/dp/0312429215/)

2666 was recommended to me by my friend A nearly a year ago. Recently another friend B brought it up in reference to the book draft I'm working on now. If it's coming up multiple times by people I trust and respect, that suggests I should read it. A suggests it would be a good thing to read as I write my current book, and would bleed over well into my work.

## 6. [The Diary of Anais Nin (Vols. 1-7)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011M9IRT8/ref=series_rw_dp_sw)

I had heard the name Anais Nin swirling around somewhere before but never really knew anything about her work. I became more interested after consistently seeing someone with the username anaisnin posting XL-size Visvim clothes on Grailed (an online, secondhand clothing marketplace). So eventually I got curious and googled her name, and it seems Ms. Nin had some interesting ideas. She wrote erotica, among other things, and her stories sometimes included the topic of incest (she and her father were apparently involved in this way). She had a love affair with Henry Miller, who wrote one of my friend A's other favorite books, if I'm remembering that right: Tropic of Cancer. Here's the two of them.

I am most curious about Nin's diaries, which she kept for six decades. I've been keeping a more-or-less daily journal in the morning. Mostly throwaway things about my upcoming day, or what I did yesterday, rather than deep thoughts and musings. I actually prefer it this way. It feels less precious and I journal more consistently. My mind feels a little clearer, generally.

Diaries are an ultimate private space, second only to the brain, where we're not writing for any audience other than ourselves. We can therefore write freely about whatever's on our minds. I get a little forbidden thrill of intimacy from the idea of reading someone else's life, someone else's brain, in this way.

I was looking on eBay to try and find a full boxed set of the diaries and someone is selling a copy of the first volume from Nin's personal library. She had a cool embossed stamp. Would love to have one myself.

Apparently you can get a custom page embosser on Etsy for about $70. Alright, I've gotta do that. No idea what image I want to use, but I'd like it to be a little humorous. I've always liked the idea of humorous monograms (something like getting F.U.C.K. embroidered onto an LL Bean tote bag).

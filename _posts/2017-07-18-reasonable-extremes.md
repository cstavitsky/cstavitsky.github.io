## Orientation Week, 2009.

During my first week of college, new students went through a set of icebreakers. One was the common 'two truths and a lie' game. Another was to give a wacky fact about yourself (careful not to get too wacky, though, lest your new peers think you're a weirdo). But there was another exercise whose format still seems valuable to me now, nearly eight years later.

It was a beautiful day in late September, still warm enough for shorts. Some new dorm-mates and I stepped out of an elevator and entered a classroom in Wieboldt. Afternoon sunlight shone through the tall gothic windows and played across the carpet. A pair of older students sat in the far corner, a thin pile of paper on the desk in front of them. They were no more than a year or two ahead of us, but they seemed infinitely more mature. They smiled at us as we came in, and motioned for us to sit down at the tables. We slid onto navy chairs made of hard resin and double-checked the schedule in our orientation folders. As more students arrived, a natural circle formed around the tables. Some of us sat with our new best friends and chatted conspiratorially. Others sat in silence and stared at their phones. When it was five minutes past the start time, the two student leaders in the corner got up and introduced themselves.

"We're going to be doing a set of exercises today," one of them said, "For which I'll need everyone to stand up."

She took a sheet of paper from the pile and walked over towards the windows on the far side of the room. "This," she said, as she taped the piece of paper to the window, "Is the Side of Extreme Agreement."

**Completely Agree**, it said.

Her associate took another sheet of paper and walked it to the opposite wall. He taped it there on the blackboard. 

**Completely Disagree**, read the notice.

"Now," said the woman, motioning back and forth at the opposite ends of the room, "We're going to ask you a series of questions, and however you feel, for each question, stand somewhere along the spectrum. You might stand all the way at either end, or exactly in the middle, or somewhere in between."

And so they asked the first question, and our student blob began to stretch out like putty along the spectrum. 

On some questions we moved a little closer to one another, forming a protective herd. I remember we all looked around nervously at where the others were standing. Nobody wanted to make a decision that drove them too far from the group. I don't remember many of the exact questions, but there was at least one or two that made people squirm.

Occasionally, someone felt very different about a question than anyone else in the group, and stood alone at one extreme on the spectrum. I recall that I was always standing with at least one other person.

There was a kind of skin-in-the-game type of atmosphere to this exercise. There was also a level of vulnerability to it, evidenced by the need to stay close to the group. It was different from dispassionately arguing something in a paper (a skill which many of us would become intimately familiar with over the coming years). We weren't just speculating and pontificating about issues, but physically planting ourselves to take a stance on something. 

## Fast-Forward 8 years.

Recently I began preparing to look for a new apartment. I'd been living in the same place for just shy of four years, with the same roommate, and it had been great in certain important ways. I didn't need to hire movers every year, nor worry about what neighborhood to be in. My roommate, a friend from college, had a hugely positive influence on what I considered important and the career choices I made. And I think that keeping my living space constant may have helped me to better weather some emotional and existential storms these last couple of years.

As my roommate prepared to move to a different city, to be closer to his longtime girlfriend, it seemed obvious that I'd move on from the apartment as well. Even if we'd stayed in the same city we probably would have switched up our living situation. I browsed Craigslist's housing section, trying to juggle the different criteria that go into selecting a place to live: what neighborhood to live in, how much to pay, studio or 1-bed or roommates, high-rise or walkup, and so on. I couldn't really figure out what was important to me in an apartment. The choices were overwhelming.

It wasn't a conscious choice, at first, but I began to single out places that were the opposite of my 4-year apartment. The old place was relatively cheap, with terrible carpeting and oddly high cabinets. My room was enormous but received almost no light. You could go directly into it, through a separate downstairs door, and avoid the common space entirely. There was a square hole in the ceiling with a spiral staircase leading upstairs, which sounds nice but also let in unwanted sound and light. If we were to position my choices on two spectrums, they might look something like this:

doesn't feel homey ...x........................... feels extremely homey

no financial freedom ...........................x... lots of financial freedom

I rarely looked forward to spending lazy weekends inside lounging around, or relaxing on the sofa after work. We actually had two terrible couches, and these two wrongs did not make a right. One was an ugly floral number with cushions that sprang free like unleashed dogs every time you sat down. Another was an uncomfortable old rectangle from IKEA with a broken arm. We hid its defects under a beige slipcover reminiscent of a burlap potato sack. I had to learn to take showers exclusively at night; in the morning, no water came out of my showerhead. Occasionally the upstairs bathroom flooded (ironically, always in the morning) and I would be awakened in the morning to drips of water falling onto my carpet from the ceiling. I'd spread t-shirts on the floor and stomp on them to absorb moisture, then rub baking soda into the damp carpet in a futile effort to reduce the musty smell.

Admittedly, my room had come a ways within the fourth and final year of my tenure at the apartment. I'd finally gotten a queen-size bed with a headboard. I'd built my own wooden table for a desk via a weekend class, and bought a white plastic rip-off of those classically simple fiberglass Eames chairs. But there was nowhere to comfortably read, or to curl up and watch Netflix.

So when it came time to look for a new place, I was aching for some hominess. And to me, nothing represented home more than a wood burning fireplace. I grew up in houses with fireplaces, and excepting one or two smoke-alarm nights where we'd forgotten to open the flue, there was nothing that added a homier feel in the winter. The fireplace also reminded me of going skiing in Vermont from age six through high school. The lodge we stayed in was old, with a wide fireplace and big bulbous stones studding the chimney, and someone or another would ball up newspapers and get a fire going every night before dinner. Given that I couldn't even decide on a neighborhood for my future apartment, 'wood-burning fireplace' became my de facto search term. I cared less about price and more about hominess.

Eventually I found a place that seemed promising. It was a one-bedroom with a wood-burning fireplace, and boasted many of the features I was looking for, plus some I never thought to expect. It was located relatively close to the downtown area without being so near my office that I would never get away from work. It had a pretty modern kitchen. Plenty of closet space. Some exposed brick walls as a nice bonus. Utilities included. Gym in the building. Timber pillars and large, bright windows. But there was one obvious rub: the cost. Oh, the cost. It was exactly double the amount of the rent I'd paid for the last four years.

## Reevaluating Held Values.

I wasn't sure what to think of this. I didn't like apartment searching; it stressed me out. I sat down and had rational conversations with my girlfriend, who I consider to be very smart and pragmatic with money. I asked her opinion on whether I should move, and although she didn't push me in a particular direction, it was clear that, were she in my position, she wouldn't be comfortable with renting the place. The cost was just too high. Still too high, even taking into account the fact that I'd have to completely upend my day-to-day lifestyle.

For the last year I'd eaten out for most meals. Buying a daily croissant and expensive coffee for breakfast had become the norm. It definitely benefited me; my mornings started off happier. But I'd also eat out for lunch and dinner and I was certain I'd gained weight. I was spending a fortune. With the new apartment, the amount I previously spent in one and a half days would need to cover a full week of food. 

For the last year, I was also spending liberally on clothes, ordered from eBay and Yahoo!Auctions (basically the Japanese version of eBay; companies running proxy websites help you place bids). Spending in the clothing category would need to dwindle down to a tiny fraction of its former self. I might be able to buy in a full year what I was previously OK with buying in a month.

Beyond the day-to-day monetary logistics, I worried about lifestyle creep. If I grew acclimated to spending more money on rent (especially *double* the previous rent), to living in a physically nicer place, it would be harder to go back to living in a mediocre apartment. Making this choice might subtly lead me to spend more on rent forever.

And despite all the downsides, I still wanted to rent the apartment. In fact, there were some unexpected upsides.

With my money and my choice to sign a lease, I would be physically aligning myself just like we did in that college classroom, somewhere between the windows and the blackboard. I would have skin in the game, and would both reap the benefits of my decision and concede to its disadvantages. 

The choice I was considering required me to place myself differently on the spectrum this time:

doesn't feel homey ..............................x. feels extremely homey

no financial freedom ......x......................... lots of financial freedom

These are the complete opposites of where I'd been placing myself before. And the most interesting part of this idea has nothing to do with apartments: it's that our values are malleable, and that making a difficult decision has the power to melt down our values, then hammer them back into a different weapon like a blacksmith.

I was willing to make a conscious decision that displayed a radically different set of values than I'd previously accepted. And by adjusting my values, I would in turn open myself up to the chance to try new experiences and develop new skills that I would have otherwise continued to overlook.

## Examine Peripheral Benefits.

Making a radical choice in one direction will shut down certain options, but you've probably heard before that constraints bolster creativity.

I examined the expensive-but-homey apartment situation and identified that some other tangential benefits were likely to come out of it.

If I had less money to spend on food overall, I'd have to eat efficiently. I'd eat a lot of the same meals with the same ingredients. I'd cook more. Over the last four months, although I've built up a consistent weightlifting habit, I still overeat.

My workplace offers free snacks and coffee. It's not as good as the breakfasts I'd get, but the free coffee and a plain yogurt or oatmeal packet make a decent breakfast that's healthier than what I previously ate.

I don't like carrying tupperware to work, nor do I like cleaning it out, so I thought about what else I might eat for lunch. I decided that Soylent, for its straightforward benefits and low-calorie amounts, would be a strong lunchtime choice. Dinner would be a mix of low-cost rice, eggs, veggies, and chicken based dishes.

The constraint provided by my budget will have the side effect of making it easier to eat healthier. Being constrained in what I can spend on food forces me to think more about it and optimize, which I think will be a huge net positive over the coming year. I think I weigh about 220lbs currently (maybe a little less), and I'm curious to see what I'll weigh in mid-July, 2018. I suspect I'll lose weight and feel healthier. It'll be hard to break from this diet much, given that I literally won't be able to afford to do so.

And in the morning, sometimes I'll have free (so-so) coffee from work. Other times I intend to use an Aeropress passed on from my roommate. The financial pressure means I can't go to coffee shops everyday, but because I'd still like to drink quality coffee, I finally have a reason to try making coffee at home. I do love coffee shops (the drinks and the atmosphere), and in the past my desire for convenience has outweighed any sprout of interest in brewing coffee at home. But now that cost is a factor, the silver lining is that I may gain a better understanding of what goes into preparing coffee--and how different brewing methods can affect taste. It'll be a hands-on thing, where I'll have the opportunity to feel a small pride in my coffee-making, and watch videos on YouTube to learn more about the best way to brew with the Aeropress. Not to mention I'll have a better atmosphere in my new apartment, which (I hope) will make it feel more like a coffee shop in its own right. I'm even considering getting a decal for the window with the name and logo of a fake coffee shop.

Making a values-based change may let you experience new, exciting ways of doing everyday things. It may let you learn valuable skills. Consider ways in which you might bend a seeming disadvantage (such as financial constraint) into a benefit. I'm excited that the food setup, born out of financial restriction, is likely to have the side benefit of making me healthier and building the habit of eating less. It's very exciting to me that deciding to move to this new apartment provided a chance to shake off the inertia of other, seemingly unrelated lifestyle choices. Our routines are more interconnected than we often give them credit for.

## Make Reversible Choices.

I already know what it's like to have relative financial freedom, eat out all the time, and live in a janky apartment, because I've experienced it. I don't yet know what it's like to live in a place I feel I can call home, while keeping a strict budget. So exploring the relative extremes, on each end of the spectrum, will allow me to speak from experience the next time I'm asked to decide my priorities. A lease is relatively temporary (one year), and if I decide that this experiment was a mistake, and that I preferred spending freely and living cheaply, then I'll be able to reverse that in a year's time.

**Making temporary choices that allow you to explore alternative value systems are highly worthwhile.**

If you wish to experiment with a different end of some value spectrum than you are currently on, I encourage you to do so (so long, of course, as it doesn't harm anyone else and will not irreparably damage you). Provided you set up a structure that will force you to stick to your newly adopted value system, you'll have a broader understanding of the spectrum you choose to place yourself on. You can use this knowledge to make more informed choices in the future.

In order to stick to a structure, I've found contracts to be helpful. I've signed the lease for my new apartment, and in doing so I've locked myself into performing. A lease is harder to break than a vague promise. I did something similar when I made a contract with my coworker, in which I pledged to write a 90,000-word novel draft in six months. I completed the challenge successfully, because if I didn't, I'd have to pay him between $1000 and $4000. To me, this was not an option, so I prioritized completing the terms of the contract.

### Your Career Shapes Your Values.

One of my friends likes to talk about the way careers shape values. The values of young people can change radically once they become doctors, firefighters, real estate agents, software engineers, lawyers, or anything in between. And before choosing a career path (or going too far along it), my friend thinks people would do well to figure out whether they're OK with adopting the system of values that tend to be associated with a given profession.

Most of us probably think we're immune. A college kid might say, "Oh, I'll become a banker, but I'm going to keep my morals intact." 

And maybe you will. But on some level, regardless of profession, you're either going to conform to the value system exhibited by the people around you, or you're going to be miserable.

It's up to you whether you choose to make that a good thing or a bad thing. Careers are slow-moving ships. Hard to turn, and even shifting the course a few degrees early on can have a huge impact on the end destination.

Right now, I'm happy to adopt the values of software engineers. I think that problem-solving, pragmatism, working effectively in a team, and a focus on quality of work over ego are both values I'm interested in strengthening. If you happen to be at a place where you might choose or change careers, consider carefully what kind of person you might grow into based on your choice.

There have been studies about how making yourself smile (even unnaturally) causes you to become happy. I'm not going to debate how compelling those studies are, but the metaphor is useful. Making a choice that forces your values to adapt will cause you to adapt those values. So think about who you'd like to be, and make conscious choices that drive you towards becoming that kind of person.

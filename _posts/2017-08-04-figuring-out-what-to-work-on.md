## This Idea's The Best Thing Ev... Hey, Look At That Other Idea!

I'm the kind of person who's constantly coming up with new ideas, usually new products or projects. Some of the ideas are terrible. Some are pretty decent and could probably enjoy mild small-scale success if I went about them right. 

My problem, though, tends to be that I get so excited and focused on the next new idea that I forget about whatever I was last working on. That doesn't mean I don't want to work on that thing. More so that I'm easily distracted, and excited by the next idea spark.

And this cycle repeats over and over. I tend to move on, because I'm constantly hopping from idea to idea as if jumping from rock to sinking rock in a pool of hot lava.

I find that focusing on ideas tends to have some of the same downsides as focusing on goals. In his book [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1491518855), Scott Adams argues that setting goals is an inherently flawed approach, and that we'd be better off using a systems-based approach.

First, I'll explain how goals-based approaches differ from systems-based approaches. Then, I'll apply this lens to my own willy-nilly, ideas-based approach to projects.

## Goal-Based Achievements Versus System-Based Achievements

Let's say that we have two people in identical situations. Each weighs 200 pounds and their doctor has told them that a healthy person of their age/height/etc. should weigh 150 pounds. Each decides to listen to the doctor and sets out to lose the weight.

Person A happens to take what we'll call a goal-based approach. He reasons that he should put his efforts towards reaching a weight of 150 pounds. He's focused primarily on reaching this outcome.

Person B understands that he must make a change in order to reach a lower weight. But instead of focusing on reaching a weight of 150 pounds, he focuses on a system of calorie counting that will cause him to lose weight, assuming he follows the system for enough time.

The way Person A has framed the problem leads him to exist in a constant state of failure from the get-go. He is 200 pounds; he must be 150 pounds to succeed, and for every excruciating moment of readjusting his diet and exercise to lose fifty pounds, he is also simultaneously failing. 

In contrast, Person B succeeds provided he follows the designed system. His success is dependent less directly on the weight he wishes to reach, and more directly on how well he has followed his system on a given day or week.

So Person A will experience failure after failure until he reaches a single success. Person B will experience success after success on a daily or weekly basis, and provided he continues to succeed on a small scale, he will eventually become healthy.

Once we reach goals we have set, suggests Adams, our purpose disappears. We then have to come up with a new goal (and therefore enter immediately into a new state of near-perpetual failure). If we use a system, instead, we will simply continue to succeed as long as we employ the methods of the system. Provided we follow systems, it's easier to succeed constantly and harder to fail.

## Ideas Are Like Goals

Goals feel good--better than systems--because they're easy to understand and communicate to ourselves and others. Ideas are the same way. If you have a clear idea for something (whether it's any good or not), you can more readily convince yourself and others that it's real.

But, like goals, ideas put us in a constant state of failure. Once we have the idea, anything short of that idea is failing. We must strive to work off our metaphorical fifty pounds (although in this case, we must work to create the thing).

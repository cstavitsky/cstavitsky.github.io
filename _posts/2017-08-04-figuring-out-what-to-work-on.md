## This Idea's The Best Thing Ev... Hey, Look At That Other Idea!

I'm the kind of person who's constantly coming up with new ideas, usually new products or projects. Some of the ideas are terrible. Some are pretty decent and could probably enjoy mild small-scale success if I went about them right. 

My problem, though, tends to be that I get so excited and focused on the next new idea that I forget about whatever I was last working on. That doesn't mean I don't want to work on that thing. More so that I'm easily distracted, and excited by the next idea spark.

And this cycle repeats over and over. I tend to move on, because I'm constantly hopping from idea to idea as if jumping from rock to sinking rock in a pool of hot lava.

I find that focusing on ideas tends to have some of the same downsides as focusing on goals. In his book [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1491518855), Scott Adams argues that setting goals is an inherently flawed approach, and that we'd be better off using a systems-based approach.

First, I'll explain how goals-based approaches differ from systems-based approaches. Then, I'll apply this lens to my own willy-nilly, ideas-based approach to projects.

## Goal-Based Achievements Versus System-Based Achievements

Let's say that we have two people in identical situations. Each weighs 200 pounds and their doctor has told them that a healthy person of their age/height/etc. should weigh 150 pounds. Each decides to listen to the doctor and sets out to lose the weight.

Person A happens to take what we'll call a goal-based approach. He reasons that he should put his efforts towards reaching a weight of 150 pounds. He's focused primarily on reaching this outcome.

Person B understands that he must make a change in order to reach a lower weight. But instead of focusing on reaching a weight of 150 pounds, he focuses on a system of calorie counting that will cause him to lose weight, assuming he follows the system for enough time.

The way Person A has framed the problem leads him to exist in a constant state of failure from the get-go. He is 200 pounds; he must be 150 pounds to succeed, and for every excruciating moment of readjusting his diet and exercise to lose fifty pounds, he is also simultaneously failing. 

In contrast, Person B succeeds provided he follows the designed system. His success is dependent less directly on the weight he wishes to reach, and more directly on how well he has followed his system on a given day or week.

So Person A will experience failure after failure until he reaches a single success. Person B will experience success after success on a daily or weekly basis, and provided he continues to succeed on a small scale, he will eventually become healthy.

Once we reach goals we have set, suggests Adams, our purpose disappears. We then have to come up with a new goal (and therefore enter immediately into a new state of near-perpetual failure). So yes, we're in a constant state of failure if we follow goals, but even worse, once we succeed, we choose the next goal and go right back to failing at something else. We spend 99% of the time failing, and 1% of the time succeeding.

If we use a system, instead, we will simply continue to succeed as long as we employ the methods of the system. Provided we follow systems, it's easier to succeed constantly and harder to fail. We may not succeed all the time, but our percentage is likely to be well over 50%. That's a lot higher than 1%, eh?

## Ideas Are Like Goals, In a Bad Way.

Goals are superficially satisfying, because they're easy to understand and communicate to ourselves and others. Ideas are the same way. If you have a clear idea for something, you can more readily convince yourself and others that it's worth working on. It seems tantalizingly within reach.

However working on an idea puts us in the same constant state of failure that setting a goal does. Once we begin work on the idea, anything short of producing the finished project feels like failure. There's a binary state of achievement (completing the idea as envisioned) and non-achievement (any state other than full completion of the idea).

So what both ideas and goals have in common with one another is that we create an expectation of what life will be like once we have achieved the idea or the goal. Who knows if the expectation is realistic. It probably isn't at all.

We discussed the merits of a system-based approach. I'll claim that there's an equivalent concept in personal project management.

## Feedback Loops

Here's a big chunk of a Wired article from 2011, about feedback loops. If you don't feel like clicking [this link](https://www.wired.com/2011/06/ff_feedbackloop/), here's the important bits.

>IN 2003, OFFICIALS in Garden Grove, California, a community of 170,000 people wedged amid the suburban sprawl of Orange County, set out to confront a problem that afflicts most every town in America: drivers speeding through school zones.

>Local authorities had tried many tactics to get people to slow down. They replaced old speed limit signs with bright new ones to remind drivers of the 25-mile-an-hour limit during school hours. Police began ticketing speeding motorists during drop-off and pickup times. But these efforts had only limited success, and speeding cars continued to hit bicyclists and pedestrians in the school zones with depressing regularity.

>So city engineers decided to take another approach. In five Garden Grove school zones, they put up what are known as dynamic speed displays, or driver feedback signs: a speed limit posting coupled with a radar sensor attached to a huge digital readout announcing “Your Speed.”

>The signs were curious in a few ways. For one thing, they didn’t tell drivers anything they didn’t already know—there is, after all, a speedometer in every car. If a motorist wanted to know their speed, a glance at the dashboard would do it. For another thing, the signs used radar, which decades earlier had appeared on American roads as a talisman technology, reserved for police officers only. Now Garden Grove had scattered radar sensors along the side of the road like traffic cones. And the Your Speed signs came with no punitive follow-up—no police officer standing by ready to write a ticket. This defied decades of law-enforcement dogma, which held that most people obey speed limits only if they face some clear negative consequence for exceeding them.

>In other words, officials in Garden Grove were betting that giving speeders redundant information with no consequence would somehow compel them to do something few of us are inclined to do: slow down.

>The results fascinated and delighted the city officials. In the vicinity of the schools where the dynamic displays were installed, drivers slowed an average of 14 percent. Not only that, at three schools the average speed dipped below the posted speed limit. Since this experiment, Garden Grove has installed 10 more driver feedback signs. “Frankly, it’s hard to get people to slow down,” says Dan Candelaria, Garden Grove’s traffic engineer. “But these encourage people to do the right thing.”

>In the years since the Garden Grove project began, radar technology has dropped steadily in price and Your Speed signs have proliferated on American roadways. Yet despite their ubiquity, the signs haven’t faded into the landscape like so many other motorist warnings. Instead, they’ve proven to be consistently effective at getting drivers to slow down—reducing speeds, on average, by about 10 percent, an effect that lasts for several miles down the road. Indeed, traffic engineers and safety experts consider them to be more effective at changing driving habits than a cop with a radar gun. Despite their redundancy, despite their lack of repercussions, the signs have accomplished what seemed impossible: They get us to let up on the gas.

>The signs leverage what’s called a feedback loop, a profoundly effective tool for changing behavior. The basic premise is simple. Provide people with information about their actions in real time (or something close to it), then give them an opportunity to change those actions, pushing them toward better behaviors. Action, information, reaction. It’s the operating principle behind a home thermostat, which fires the furnace to maintain a specific temperature, or the consumption display in a Toyota Prius, which tends to turn drivers into so-called hypermilers trying to wring every last mile from the gas tank. But the simplicity of feedback loops is deceptive. They are in fact powerful tools that can help people change bad behavior patterns, even those that seem intractable. Just as important, they can be used to encourage good habits, turning progress itself into a reward. In other words, feedback loops change human behavior. And thanks to an explosion of new technology, the opportunity to put them into action in nearly every part of our lives is quickly becoming a reality.

Systems-based approaches tend to work best when there's a good feedback loop. Our system-based weight-loss buddy, Person B, is tracking his calories daily to understand how much food he's putting into his body. Simply being aware of how much he is eating will influence his behavior, even though the calorie tracker does not force him to eat any differently. It's a near 1:1 of the speed limit example from the Wired article.

For me, as someone with a mind that jumps from idea to idea naturally, I need to have some kind of feedback loop. Right now, that happens to be a pretty low-tech solution. In fact, I can link you to it, right here: http://irrationallyexcited.com/currently/

I'm meant to put whatever my current focuses are on this page. If I'm focused on it, I put it on the page. If it's on the page, then it's something I should focus on. I made this handy little flowchart to remind myself.

(p.s. I used https://www.lucidchart.com/ to make this, if you're ever looking for an online flowchart maker)

It calls my idea-hopping to my attention if I'm constantly updating the page. I actually started with a specific project on there (which I added excitedly immediately after having it). Two days later I realized I didn't really care, and deleted it. Since then, I've been more hesitant about adding projects.

In fact, I found that I avoided adding ideas at all. Instead, I've mostly got learning resources. They just happen to overlap with the skills that I'm interested in building. Learning resources remind me of a system-based approach: because if I engage with the learning resources, I've succeeded. If I watch the video and practice my drawing, I've succeeded. And as a side effect I've strengthened some piece of my drawing skill. Just like a side effect of calorie counting is losing weight.

Letting your achievements become side effects of your actions, instead of the pressure-filled main event, is a much more relaxing way of approaching ambition.

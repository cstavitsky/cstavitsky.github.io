## What's Idea-Based Effort?

I'm the kind of person who's constantly coming up with new ideas, usually new products or projects. Some of the ideas are terrible. Some are pretty decent and could probably enjoy mild small-scale success if I went about them right. 

The problem is that I get so excited and focused on the next new idea that I forget about whatever I was last working on. That doesn't mean I don't want to work on that thing. More so that I'm easily distracted, and excited by the next idea spark.

And this cycle repeats over and over. I tend to move on, because I'm constantly hopping from idea to idea as if jumping from rock to sinking rock in a pool of hot lava.

(The phenomenon only happens in my personal projects. At work, it isn't an issue; I can refer to our team's project management board to figure out whatever I need to do next. Project Managers do the heavy lifting in terms of defining units of work that will lead to some business impact.)

I find idea-based efforts to be problematic for the same reason that goal-based efforts are. In his book [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1491518855), Scott Adams argues that setting goals is an inherently flawed approach, and that we'd be better off using a systems-based approach. 

First, I'll explain how goals-based approaches differ from systems-based approaches. Then, I'll apply this lens to the willy-nilly, ideas-based approach to projects I described earlier.

Let's say that we have two people in identical situations. Each weighs 200 pounds and their doctor has told them that a healthy person of their age/height/etc. should weigh 150 pounds. Each decides to listen to the doctor and sets out to lose the weight.

Person A happens to take what we'll call a goal-based approach. He reasons that he should put his efforts towards reaching a weight of 150 pounds. He's focused primarily on reaching this outcome.

Person B understands that he must make a change in order to reach a lower weight. But instead of focusing on reaching a weight of 150 pounds, he focuses on a system of calorie counting that will cause him to lose weight, assuming he follows the system for enough time.

The way Person A has framed the problem leads him to exist in a constant state of failure from the get-go. He is 200 pounds; he must be 150 pounds to succeed, and for every excruciating moment of readjusting his diet and exercise to lose fifty pounds, he is also simultaneously failing. 

In contrast, Person B succeeds provided he follows his 

Once we reach the goals, we've lost purpose and have to come up with a new goal (and therefore a new state of near-perpetual failure). In contrast, Adams prefers systems-based approaches, in which we focus on designing and following a system that will move us in a positive direction. If

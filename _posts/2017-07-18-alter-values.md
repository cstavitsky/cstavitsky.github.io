title: Want To Alter Your Values? Make Big Decisions

Recently I began preparing to look for a new apartment. I'd been living in the same place for just shy of four years, with the same roommate. There were some big benefits to this. I didn't need to hire movers every year. I didn't need worry about what neighborhood to choose. My roommate, a friend from college, had a hugely positive influence on what I considered important and the career choices I made. And I think that keeping my living space constant may have helped me to better weather some emotional and existential storms these last couple of years.

As my roommate prepared to move to a different city, to be closer to his longtime girlfriend, it seemed obvious that I'd move on from the apartment as well. Even if we'd stayed in the same city we probably would have switched up our living arrangement. I browsed Craigslist's housing section, trying to juggle the different criteria that go into selecting a place to live: what neighborhood to live in, how much to pay, studio or 1-bed or roommates, high-rise or walkup, and so on. I couldn't really figure out what was important to me in an apartment. The choices were overwhelming.

It wasn't a conscious decision, at first, but I began to single out places that were the opposite of my 4-year apartment. The old place was relatively cheap, with terrible carpeting and oddly high cabinets. My room was enormous but received almost no light. You could go directly into it, through a separate downstairs door, and avoid the common space entirely. There was a square hole in the ceiling with a spiral staircase leading upstairs, which sounds nice but also let in unwanted sound and light. If we were to position my choices on two spectrums, they might look something like this:

I rarely looked forward to spending lazy weekends inside lounging around. I never relaxed on the sofa after work. We actually had two terrible couches, and these two wrongs did not make a right. One was an ugly floral number with cushions that sprang free like unleashed dogs every time you sat down. Another was an uncomfortable old rectangle from IKEA with a broken arm. We hid its defects under a beige slipcover reminiscent of a burlap potato sack.

It was not only the living room that contributed to this feeling. I'd been trained to shower exclusively at night, because in the mornings, nothing but a slow cold trickle exited my showerhead. Occasionally the upstairs bathroom flooded (ironically, always in the morning) and I would be awakened to drips of water falling onto my carpet from the ceiling. I'd spread t-shirts on the floor and stomp on them to absorb moisture, then rub baking soda into the damp carpet in a futile effort to reduce the musty smell.

Admittedly, my room had come a ways within the fourth and final year of my tenure at the apartment. I'd finally gotten a queen-size bed with a headboard. I'd built my own wooden table for a desk during a summer woodworking class, and bought a white plastic rip-off of those classically simple fiberglass Eames chairs. But there was still nowhere to comfortably read, or to curl up and watch Netflix. The walls had random cracks in them. The paint job was mediocre.

So when it came time to look for a new place, I was aching for some hominess. And to me, nothing represented home more than a wood burning fireplace. I grew up in houses with fireplaces, and excepting one or two smoke-alarm nights where we'd forgotten to open the flue, there was nothing that added a homier feel in the winter. The fireplace also reminded me of going skiing in Vermont from age six through high school. The lodge we stayed in was old, with a wide fireplace and big bulbous stones studding the chimney, and someone or another would ball up newspapers and get a fire going every night before dinner. Given that I couldn't even decide on a neighborhood for my future apartment, 'wood-burning fireplace' became my de facto search term. I started caring less about price in my searches, and more about achieving that feeling of hominess I hadn't yet prioritized in my adult life.

Eventually I found a place that seemed promising. It was a one-bedroom with a wood-burning fireplace, and boasted many of the features I was looking for, plus some I never thought to expect. It was located relatively close to the downtown area without being so near my office that I would never get away from work. It had a pretty modern kitchen. Plenty of closet space. Some exposed brick walls as a nice bonus. Utilities included. Gym in the building. Timber pillars and large, bright windows. But there was one obvious rub: the cost. Oh, the cost. It was exactly double the amount of the rent I'd paid for the last four years.

## Reevaluating Held Values.

I wasn't sure what to think of this. I didn't like apartment searching; it stressed me out. I sat down and had rational conversations with my girlfriend, who I consider to be very smart and pragmatic with money. I asked her opinion on whether I should move, and although she didn't push me in a particular direction, it was clear that, were she in my position, she wouldn't be comfortable with renting the place. The cost was just too high. Still too high, even taking into account the fact that I'd have to completely upend my day-to-day lifestyle.

For the last year I'd eaten out for most meals. Buying a daily croissant and expensive coffee for breakfast had become the norm. It definitely benefited me; my mornings started off happier. But I'd also eat out for lunch and dinner and I was certain I'd gained weight. I was spending a fortune. With the new apartment, the amount I previously spent in one and a half days would need to cover a full week of food. 

For the last year, I was also spending liberally on clothes, ordered from eBay and Yahoo!Auctions (basically the Japanese version of eBay; companies running proxy websites help you place bids). Spending in the clothing category would need to dwindle down to a tiny fraction of its former self. I might be able to buy in a full year what I was previously OK with buying in a month.

Beyond the day-to-day monetary logistics, I worried about lifestyle creep. If I grew acclimated to spending more money on rent (especially *double* the previous rent), to living in a physically nicer place, it would be harder to go back to living in a mediocre apartment. Making this choice might subtly lead me to spend more on rent forever.

And despite all the downsides, I still wanted to rent the apartment. In fact, I recognized that making this decision would provide unexpected upsides.

With my money and my choice to sign a lease, I re-aligned myself on the spectrum of values from earlier. I would have skin in the game, and would both reap the benefits of my decision and concede to its disadvantages.

The choice I was considering required me to place myself differently on the spectrum this time. This diagram looks similar to the previous one, but don't be fooled: my preferences completely flipped.

The most interesting aspect of my value adjustments has nothing to do with apartments. _Our values are malleable; making a difficult decision has the power to melt down our values, then hammer them back into a different weapon like a blacksmith._

I made a conscious decision that supported a radically different set of values than I'd previously accepted. And by adjusting my values, I opened myself up to the chance to try new experiences and develop new skills that I would have otherwise continued to overlook.

## Examine Peripheral Benefits.

Making a radical choice in one direction will shut down certain options, but you've probably heard before that constraints bolster creativity.

I examined the expensive-but-homey apartment situation and identified that some other tangential benefits were likely to come out of it. These benefits wouldn't arise if my preferences stayed inert.

Over the last four months, although I've built up a consistent weightlifting habit, I still tend to overeat. If I had less money to spend on food overall, I'd have to eat efficiently. I'd eat a lot of the same meals with the same ingredients. I'd cook more. 

My workplace offers free snacks and coffee. It's not as good as the breakfasts I'd get, but the free coffee and a plain yogurt or oatmeal packet make a decent breakfast that's healthier than what I previously ate.

I don't like carrying tupperware to work, nor do I like cleaning it out, so I thought about what else I might eat for lunch. I decided that Soylent, for its straightforward benefits and low-calorie amounts, would be a strong lunchtime choice (I don't care enough to research the benefits of other brands of synth-food blends). Dinner would be a mix of low-cost rice, eggs, veggies, and chicken based dishes.

In short, I believe constraint provided by my budget will have the side effect of making it easier to eat healthier. Being constrained in what I can spend on food forces me to think more about it and optimize, which I think will be a huge net positive over the coming year. I think I weigh about 220lbs currently (maybe a little less), and I'm curious to see what I'll weigh in mid-July, 2018. I suspect I'll have lost weight and that I'll feel healthier. All as a side effect of choosing where to live. It'll be hard to break from this diet very much, given that I literally won't be able to afford to do so.

(side note: my budget calculations account for saving a certain set amount of money each month.)

In the morning, sometimes I'll have the free (so-so) coffee from work. Other times (weekends, likely) I intend to use an Aeropress passed on from my roommate. The financial pressure means I can't go to coffee shops everyday like I used to, but I'd still like to drink quality coffee. Well, that gives me an excuse to try making coffee at home. I do love coffee shops (the drinks and the atmosphere), and in the past my desire for convenience has outweighed any sprout of interest in brewing coffee at home. But now that cost is a factor, the silver lining is that I'll likely gain a better understanding of what goes into preparing coffee--and how different brewing methods can affect taste. It'll be a hands-on thing, where I'll have the opportunity to feel some small pride in my coffee-making, and watch videos on YouTube to learn more about the best way to brew with the Aeropress. I'm aware that I probably sound like a tech douche, but I'll accept that risk in order to share my excitement with you.

Not to mention I'll have a better atmosphere in my new apartment, which (I hope) will make it feel more like a coffee shop in its own right. I'm even considering getting a decal for the window with the name and logo of a fake coffee shop. I haven't really thought much about that yet. Nope. Haven't thought about it at all.

![Not that I've thought about the logo much yet.......](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cstavitsky/cstavitsky.github.io/master/_posts/chris_coffee_badge.png)

(Nah- if I do actually do the decal thing, I'll probably take it a little more seriously. Give it a fancy name and whatnot. Maybe hours of operation.)

So: making a values-based change may let you experience new, exciting ways of doing everyday things. It may let you learn valuable skills. Consider ways in which you might bend a seeming disadvantage (such as financial constraint) into a benefit. I'm excited that the food plan, born out of financial restriction, is likely to have the side benefit of making me healthier and building the habit of eating less. I'm also excited to learn to brew coffee at home. It's very exciting to me that deciding to move to this new apartment provided a chance to shake off the inertia of other, seemingly unrelated lifestyle choices. Our routines really are more interconnected than we often give them credit for.

## Make Reversible Choices.

I already know what it's like to have relative financial freedom, eat out all the time, and live in a janky apartment, because I've experienced it. I don't yet know what it's like to live in a place I feel I can call home, while keeping a strict budget. So exploring the relative extremes, on each end of the spectrum, will allow me to speak from experience the next time I'm asked to decide my priorities. A lease is relatively temporary (one year), and if I decide that this experiment was a mistake, and that I preferred spending freely and living cheaply, then I'll be able to reverse that without much trouble in a year's time.

If you wish to experiment with a different end of some value spectrum than you are currently on, I encourage you to do so (so long, of course, as it doesn't harm anyone else and will not irreparably damage you). Provided you set up a structure that will force you to stick to your newly adopted value system, you'll have a broader understanding of the spectrum you choose to place yourself on. You can use this knowledge to make more informed choices in the future.

This probably isn't for everyone, but in order to stick to a structure, I've found contracts to be helpful. I've signed the lease for my new apartment, and in doing so I've locked myself into performing. A lease is harder to break than a vague promise. And I did something similar last September when I made a contract with my coworker, in which I pledged to write a 90,000-word novel draft in six months. I felt I had to complete the challenge successfully, because if I didn't, I'd have to pay him between $1000 and $4000. To me, this was not an option, so I prioritized completing the terms of the contract over paying him.

### Your Career Shapes Your Values.

One of my friends likes to talk about the way careers shape values. The values of young people can change radically once they become doctors, firefighters, real estate agents, software engineers, lawyers, or anything in between. And before choosing a career path (or going too far along it), my friend thinks people would do well to figure out whether they're OK with adopting the system of values that tend to be associated with a given profession.

Most of us probably think we're immune. A college kid might say, "Oh, I'll become a banker, but I'm going to keep my morals intact." 

And maybe you will. But on some level, regardless of profession, you're either going to conform to the value system exhibited by the people around you, or you're going to be miserable.

Right now, I'm happy to adopt the values of software engineers. I think that problem-solving, pragmatism, working effectively in a team, and a focus on quality of work over ego are all values I'm interested in strengthening. If you happen to be at a place where you might choose or change careers, consider carefully what kind of person you might grow into based on your choice.

There have been studies about how making yourself smile (even unnaturally) causes you to become happy. I'm not going to debate how compelling those studies are, but the metaphor is useful. Making a choice that forces your values to adapt will cause you to adapt those values. So think about who you'd like to be, and make conscious choices that drive you towards becoming that kind of person.

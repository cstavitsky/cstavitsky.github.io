title: First Week of Remote Work

My first week of remote work is in the books. So far it's been great. Here's a summary of how the week went, with a few 'retro'-style on what went well and what didn't.

On **Monday and Tuesday**, I kept the same schedule. First, I worked at home in the morning (in a small room designated only for working, with a desk and ergonomic office chair). I've been using only one monitor. Although some people prefer as many screens as possible, I notice sharply diminishing returns after the first monitor.

I only had morning meetings on those days, so I felt a little freer being mobile.

Around lunchtime, I took the train downtown to the rock climbing gym and climbed. I didn't time myself, but I probably spent around forty minutes each day climbing.

Then, because the gym has wifi, and some seating, I changed out of my gym clothes and worked at the gym.

In the afternoon on Monday and Tuesday, I did a quick video check-in with a friend of mine who works remote at another company. He lives on the East Coast. We did a kind of quasi-standup, where we talked about how our days were going, and also got some socialization in.

Around 4:30, I left and went home. I really enjoyed the feeling of coming back home from downtown; it simulated the regular commute from the office (being on the same train) and felt like it helped to separate the workday and my evening at home.

On **Wednesday**, I was back in the office for our all-hands meeting (which ended up getting cancelled). I got lunch with a couple coworkers and used the time to check in in-person where possible. Ironically, most of my team was working remote that day for various reasons.

On **Thursday** I helped my girlfriend out with an apartment-maintenance appointment. I worked from her apartment for a bit, then around lunchtime headed back to my apartment.

I had a 1:1 and an IPM that day, so opted to stay home rather than go to the gym. After the 1:1 and IPM, which ended in mid-afternoon, I walked to a local coffee shop for a break (unfortunately, I forgot to take a real lunch break that day). I worked at the coffee shop the rest of the afternoon until the workday ended.

On **Friday**, I worked at home in the morning. I had a couple of morning meetings. In the late afternoon, when the day was nearly over, I headed downtown to meet my girlfriend and our mutual friend for coffee. She and I walked over to the gym afterwards and worked out.

## Start
- Taking more breaks. Without walking to and from meetings, and coworkers in the office, I noticed myself taking fewer short 5-minute breaks to refresh. This led to me feeling stale in the afternoon.
- Cleaning my apartment better. I'm spending more time here working -- the mild clutter isn't that bad, but it is a little oppressive/distracting.

## Stop
- Nothing I can think of so far, I thought things went well overall.

## Continue
- Going to the gym around lunch. On days when I don't have a lot of meetings in the afternoon, this worked amazingly. It served as a refresher and kept me in a good mood.
- Working from places other than my home in the afternoon. This is an excuse to get out of my apartment.
- Getting coffee with people downtown in the afternoon. Another excuse to get out of my apartment and get some human contact!
- Keeping a journal of my experience.

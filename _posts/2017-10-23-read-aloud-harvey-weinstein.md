No. 1: Harvey Weinstein and the Economics of Consent

My girlfriend sent me an [article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-and-the-economics-of-consent/543618/) today. It was written by Brit Marling and adds another voice to the ongoing Harvey Weinstein sexual assault/harrassment saga.

Some people prefer to listen to things than to read them (while they work out, commute, cook), and it occurred to me that folks might enjoy listening to the occasional high-quality article in its unaltered glory. So I decided to record myself reading this piece aloud.

I understand that some may feel that hearing this piece read by a man (not a woman, not remotely involved in Hollywood, not assaulted) destroys or warps the impact of this piece. Please know that I'm just trying to make something I found thought-provoking more accessible, using the tools that I have (a little clip-on lavalier mic and my voice). I'll leave you with a quote from the article. After that, go ahead and click on the link above to listen to it.

> The things that happen in hotel rooms and board rooms all over the world (and in every industry) between women seeking employment or trying to keep employment and men holding the power to grant it or take it away exist in a gray zone where words like “consent” cannot fully capture the complexity of the encounter. Because consent is a function of power. You have to have a modicum of power to give it. In many cases women do not have that power because their livelihood is in jeopardy and because they are the gender that is oppressed by a daily, invisible war waged against all that is feminine—women and humans who behave or dress or think or feel or look feminine.

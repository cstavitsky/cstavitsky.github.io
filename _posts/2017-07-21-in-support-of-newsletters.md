title: In Praise of Newsletters

On September 9, 2016, I sent out the first **Tromple** email newsletter. The conceit of **Tromple** was, and still is:

> (Once every few weeks or so, I collect a small number of links (articles, images, sometimes videos or even full-on movies) centered loosely on a single theme. Then, I send them out in a little digest called Tromple.)

A few weeks prior to that first issue I emailed, I'd been conversations about food authenticity. I happened to read this [article about the lack of truffles in truffle oil](https://priceonomics.com/there-are-no-truffles-in-truffle-oil/). I began thinking about other types of counterfeits, and I found myself dredging up memories of going to Chinatown as a child and ogling the fake Pok√©mon cards and (once I had developed truly sophisticated tastes, by age ten) Rolexes. 

These concepts clumped together in a way that made sense to me. I decided this might be my chance to emulate the format of a mysterious, one-off digital 'magazine' (there was only [ever one issue](http://observist.net/)) I found a couple years ago. This 'magazine', called 'The Observist', was a collection of links around a single theme: Hermits.

The Observist, Issue 1, was like a large wrapped present containing several smaller ones. It led to various articles, movies/documentaries, TED talks, even books. I was struck by the feeling that someone (someone being [Tom van Beveren](http://tomvanbeveren.nl/), a Dutch UX designer, according to his website) had put thought and effort into gathering all these various Hermit-related items and making the whole greater than the sum of its parts. I loved this first issue of the Observist and was surprised that he never created more. Tom, if you ever happen to come across this, I'm glad you made that Hermits issue. I can't even remember how I found it, but it definitely made a great impression on me.

I privately pretended that I was continuing the Observist's brief legacy with my first issue of Tromple. The thing was barebones, an image-free email with no proprietary content except my brief comments. But despite its simplicity, I liked thinking of it as a magazine: ongoing and with issues that focused on one concept at a time. I figured that, like the Observist, I'd provide the links and a brief, impartial summary.

Then the next question arose: once compiled, who would I send it to?

I figured I'd send it to some of my close friends, who I usually email random links to, and then it struck me that this might be a great way to keep in touch with others whom it's harder to keep day to day contact with. Some of us may no longer live in the same city, or work together, but these are I felt were genuinely curious folks, who might be interested in receiving interesting content. I sent the first issue to people ranging from their early twenties to their seventies and everywhere in between.

I didn't use an app to create any kind of bulk mailing list. Tromple didn't have any legs yet, and it hadn't proven itself important enough for this. Instead, I sent the newsletter directly to myself and BCC'ed all the receipients. There were a couple of reasons for this. First, I wasn't interested in trying to acquire subscribers. That would have taken the focus away from providing interesting content and keeping in touch with people I wanted to. I sent Tromple only to people I knew, and who knew me.

Second, I wanted to make sure people actually got the email! As a Gmail user, I tend to see Mailchimp/Tinyletter emails filtered into my 'Social' tab -- a wasteland of unwanted Facebook updates and store spam. I didn't want this to happen to the people I sent Tromple to. I meant to make it clear to them that this was specifically for them. It wasn't autogenerated and prettified by an app, and it wasn't there to sell anything or even self-propagate. It was as natural as just shooting them an email.

I sent out the first issue and got a bunch of responses back. People seemed to like it. A few people I hadn't spoken to for a while sent me a note and I was thrilled to hear from them.

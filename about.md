I enjoy writing. In school I had an English minor and once believed I might end up as a copywriter (although, to be honest, I don't think my expectations matched up with the reality).

Now that I work in software development, I don't really have a day-to-day outlet for my thoughts. The culture is more focused on problem-solving and less about reflecting on non-technical things. The type of analysis used to solve programming problems might have some overlap with analytical essay-writing, but many programmers tend to blog about code or starting a startup.

It's likely that I'll also talk about these things (like in the `Theme` section just below), but readers of this blog shouldn't _have_ to be programmers or people interested in starting companies to find the posts compelling. 

If you think I've fallen short in any way, please shoot me a note at `corridorr@gmail.com` and let me know what I can do to improve. There isn't a comment system here, but I always welcome your thoughts on any blog posts. If your feedback is kind, I'll be more receptive to it.

## Theme
This is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) blog. Jekyll sites generate static html pages, rather than making extra calls to load up content from a database. Learn more about this [on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-static-site-generator-like-Jekyll-work). I don't need any user generated content here, so this works great for me.

It's hosted for free on Github Pages, which is one of the main reasons I chose it. I looked into other blogging platforms like Ghost, but even hosting it yourself, you're going to be paying at least $5-10 per month. That adds up!

The theme is called Tale and you can [find and fork the original repository here](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale).

Thanks for reading!

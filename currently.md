## Currently Cooking:
* [Trader Joe's Salmon Burger](https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/536). Keeping it simple!
* [Tomato and White Sultana Chutney](https://www.lebonmagot.com/our-products1/tomato-and-white-sultana-chutney). This spread is so, so good. I picked it up at Pastoral in Chicago. I've been making open-faced grilled cheeses for breakfast -- heat a pan on low, spread this chutney on bread and put a few blobs of goat cheese on. Place on the pan and cover, letting the cheese melt a little. So good.... *drool*

## Currently YouTubing:
* This [Lo-fi hiphop set](https://youtu.be/0cKzCUdtRh8)
* [Iterative Drawing - The Fastest Way to Improve - Sycra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ufz75UvHs&feature=youtu.be) 55 minutes? This might be the longest YouTube video I've ever watched. Definitely worth watching if you're an analytical person interested in improving your intuitive drawing.
* [Stumptown Coffee shows how to use an Aeropress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmjPjZZRhNQ&t=4s). I've been making coffee pretty much every morning for 2-3 months thanks to this! I don't care all too much about temperature, measurements, brew time, etc., so while on some level it's kind of funny that he's putting all this effort into making a perfect cup while in the woods, I also appreciate that it feels less clinical than when done in a fancy coffee shop surrounded by scales and glass beakers.
